# translate to clip

Rofi menu that uses the [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) API to translate text on multiple languages on the fly.  
I recommend putting the script on your path and execute it with a custom key combination.

Use it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcelarie/rofi-translate-to-clip.git
cd rofi-translate-to-clip
chmod +x ./rofi-translate.sh
./rofi-translate.sh
```

You will need to install [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) and
you may need to install [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) too.
